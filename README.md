This is code I created to help me solve Cryptology, MAT391, which I took at York College of Pennsylvania during the Fall semester of 2018. Many classes are not finished, due to the fact I did not code anything beyond my needs. I may continue work on this at a later date. Some classes are abandoned entirely and replaced by others, but I left the older files there for archival purposes.
